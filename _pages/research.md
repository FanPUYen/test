My research covers coding and information theory, post-quantum cryptography, communications and signal processing, with an emphasis on lattices and their applications. A lattice is a regular array of points which basically generalizes the concept of the integers to multiple dimensions. For this reason, lattices are central objects studied in modern number theory. Perhaps the most famous application of lattices is sphere packing, which gives rise to their prominent role in information theory. More recently, lattices have been used to construct capacity-achieving codes over wireless fading channels, and have emerged as the most promising candidate of post-quantum cryptography. Our research lies on the interface of information theory, number theory, cryptography and quantum information. Current interests are

- Lattice coding and cryptography
- Coding and wireless communications
- Information theory
- Signal processing
